The `JACK API <https://jackaudio.org/>`_ implements
an audio server, allowing
the connection of various software clients and
hardware interfaces.
In short, it turns the whole
system into a digital audio workstation (DAW).
It is the pro audio standard on Linux systems,
but is also available for Mac and Windows.
