Beginnings of Computer Music
----------------------------

Digital sound synthesis dates back to the first
experiments of Max Mathews at Bell Labs
in the 1950s. Mathews created the MUSIC
programming language for generating musical
sounds through additive synthesis on
an IBM 704.
*The Silver Scale*, realized by Newman Guttman in 1957,
is (probably) the first ever digitally
synthesized piece of music (Roads, 1980):

MUSIC and its versions (I, II, III, ...)
are direct or indirect ancestors to most
recent languages for sound processing.
Although the first experiments sound amusing
from todays perspective, Mathews already grasped the
potential of the computer as a musical instrument:

    *“There are no theoretical limitations to the performance of the computer as a source of musical sounds, in contrast to the performance of ordinary instruments.”* (Mathews, 1963)

    
Mathews created the first digital musical
pieces himself, but in order to fully explore the musical
potential, he was joined by composers, artists and other
researchers, such as Newman Guttman, James Tenney
and Jean Claude Risset. Later, the Bell Labs were visited
by renowned composers of various genres, including
John Cage, Edgard Varèse and Laurie Spiegel (Park, 2009).
