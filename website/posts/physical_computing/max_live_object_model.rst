Max's Live Object Model makes it possible to exchange data between
Max for Live and any parameter of a Live session.
The model is best described in the
`Max Online Documentation  <https://docs.cycling74.com/max8/vignettes/live_object_model>`_.
and the
`Live API Overview <https://docs.cycling74.com/max8/vignettes/live_api_overview>`_

In the following examples, different Live parameters are controlled via
LFOs or direct input to demonstrate the capabilities.


----

The Live Object Model
=====================

Working with the Live Object Model involves four objects:

- The ``live.path`` object is used to select objects in the Live object hierarchy. It receives a message, pointing to the object which is to be accessed.

- ``live.object`` is used to get and set properties and children of objects and to call their functions.

- The ``live.observer`` object can subscribe to properties of objects and their children and gets regular updates on changes.

- With the ``live.parameter~`` object it is possible to control Live device parameters in real time.


----

Controlling the Live Set
========================

This first example allows to change the playback speed of the Live session in BPM.
The live object only needs the path to the Live set (``live_set``) and
can then process the ``set tempo $1`` message.

Triggering Clips
================

Each clip in Live's session view can be accessed with an individual path.

Once set with the ``goto ...`` message, the ``call fire`` message can trigger the sample.

Controlling Device Parameters
=============================


By controlling device parameters, any synth or effect inside a Live
project can be automated from Max For Live patches.
Although this is a very powerful feature, paths to the objects need to be tracked
down by the indices of the channel, the plugin and the parameter.



-----

Instrument Channels
-------------------


In this example, the Granulator II is used. It can be installed via
the `Ableton Website <https://www.ableton.com/en/packs/granulator-ii/>`_.
The first thing to do is find the right path for the device and parameter.

Main Channel
------------

Main channel effects and plugins can be controlled in the same way as those in instrument channels,
omitting the channel index.

.. admonition:: Exercise

		Combine the above patches with the Max for Live sensor examples to directly control Live parameters with the Arduino.
