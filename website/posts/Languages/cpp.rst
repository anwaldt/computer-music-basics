C++ is the standard for programming professional,
efficient audio software. Most of the languages and environments introduced in
the *Computer Music Basics* class are programmed in C++ themselves.
When adding low level components, such as UGens in SuperCollider,
objects in Pure Data or VST plugins for Digital Audio Workstations (DAW),
these are programmed in C++, based on the respective API.
These APIs take over the communication with the hardware and offer convenient
features for control and communication.
