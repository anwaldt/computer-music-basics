`Faust <https://faust.grame.fr/>`_ is a functional audio programming
language, developed at GRAME, Lyon. It is a community-driven,
free open source project.
Faust is specifically suited for quickly designing
musical synthesis and processing software and
compiling it for a large variety of targets.
The fastest way for getting started with Faust
in the `Faust online IDE <https://faustide.grame.fr/>`_ which allows programming
and testing code in the browser, without any installation.
The online materials for the class `Sound Synthesis- Building Instruments with Faust </teaching/building-instruments-in-faust/>`_ introduce the basics of the Faust language and give examples for different synthesis techniques.

Besides many targets, Faust can also be used to create ScriptProcessor nodes (Letz, 2015).
